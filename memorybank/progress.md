# Progress: Fit Coach AI

**What Works:**

*   Created the initial memory bank files:
    *   `projectbrief.md`
    *   `productContext.md`
    *   `activeContext.md`
    *   `systemPatterns.md`
    *   `techContext.md`
*   Created the Next.js application using `create-next-app`.
*   Implemented user authentication with JWT.
*   Connected to the Neon DB database.
*   Created the `users` table in the Neon DB database.
*   Created the landing page, authentication page, home page, and 4 additional pages.
*   Created the AI Agent API route.
*   The AI Agent API route now receives requests and returns a response.
*   The AI Agent API route now identifies the user's intent and routes the request to the appropriate microservice.
*   Created the exercise and nutrition microservices.
*   The AI Agent now routes requests to the exercise and nutrition microservices.
*   Implemented personalized exercise plans in the exercise microservice.
*   Implemented personalized nutrition plans in the nutrition microservice.
*   Created the `progress` table in the Neon DB database.
*   Implemented progress tracking API with endpoints for:
    *   Fetching user progress data (GET)
    *   Creating new progress entries (POST)
    *   Updating existing progress entries (PUT)
    *   Deleting progress entries (DELETE)
*   Fixed TypeScript linting errors by replacing `any` types with more specific types.

**What's Left to Build:**

*   Implement the AI Agent with multiple orchestrated agents.
*   Implement personalized exercise and nutrition plans.
*   Implement a user interface for progress tracking.
*   Implement community features.
*   Integrate with wearable devices.
*   Implement gamification.
*   Implement mental wellness tools.
*   Implement expert coaching.

**Current Status:**

*   The project is in the development phase.
*   The Next.js application has been created.
*   User authentication has been implemented with JWT.
*   The application is connected to the Neon DB database.
*   The `users` and `progress` tables have been created.
*   The basic pages have been created.
*   The AI Agent API route has been implemented.
*   The exercise and nutrition microservices have been implemented.
*   Progress tracking API endpoints have been implemented.
*   TypeScript linting errors have been fixed.

**Known Issues:**

*   None at this time.

**Evolution of Project Decisions:**

*   The application will function as an AI Agent with multiple orchestrated agents.
*   Nutrition plans will be tailored to the user's region.
*   The application was created using Turbopack.
