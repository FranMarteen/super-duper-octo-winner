# Active Context: Fit Coach AI

**Current Work Focus:**

*   Developing a Next.js React application with Neon DB and JWT authentication.
*   Implementing progress tracking functionality.
*   Creating and maintaining the memory bank files.
*   Implementing microservices for exercise and nutrition recommendations.
*   Fixing TypeScript linting errors.
*   Preparing for the implementation of a user interface for progress tracking.
*   Planning the enhancement of the AI Agent to provide more personalized recommendations.

**Recent Changes:**

*   Created the `projectbrief.md` file with the project goal, key features, target audience, technologies, and pages.
*   Created the `productContext.md` file with information about the problems solved, how it should work, and user experience goals.
*   Created the `systemPatterns.md` file with information about the system architecture, key technical decisions, design patterns, component relationships, and critical implementation paths.
*   Created the `techContext.md` file with information about the technologies used, development setup, technical constraints, dependencies, and tool usage patterns.
*   Created the `progress.md` file with information about what works, what's left to build, the current status, known issues, and evolution of project decisions.
*   Created the Next.js application using `create-next-app`.
*   Created the `register.ts` and `login.ts` API routes for user authentication.
*   Installed the `@types/bcrypt`, `@types/jsonwebtoken`, and `@neondatabase/serverless` packages.
*   Created the `.env.local` file and added the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.
*   Created the `create-table.ts` API route to create the `users` table.
*   Installed the `pg` package.
*   Successfully created the `users` table in the Neon DB database.
*   Created the landing page, authentication page, home page, and 4 additional pages: `page1`, `page2`, `page3`, and `page4`.
*   Created the AI Agent API route.
*   Implemented personalized exercise plans in the exercise microservice.
*   Implemented personalized nutrition plans in the nutrition microservice.
*   Created the `create-progress-table` API route to create the `progress` table.
*   Successfully created the `progress` table in the Neon DB database.
*   Created the `progress` API route with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE endpoints for tracking user progress.
*   Fixed TypeScript linting errors in various files by replacing `any` types with more specific types.

**Next Steps:**

*   Implement the AI Agent with multiple orchestrated agents.
*   Create a user interface for progress tracking to utilize the progress API endpoints.
*   Implement community features.
*   Integrate with wearable devices.
*   Implement gamification.
*   Implement mental wellness tools.
*   Implement expert coaching.
*   Enhance the AI Agent to provide more personalized recommendations based on user progress data.
*   Create a dashboard to visualize user progress over time.
*   Implement user profile pages to display and edit user information.

**Active Decisions and Considerations:**

*   The application will function as an AI Agent with multiple orchestrated agents.
*   Nutrition plans will be tailored to the user's region.
*   The application was created using Turbopack.

**Important Patterns and Preferences:**

*   Use Next.js for the frontend framework.
*   Use React for building the UI components.
*   Use Neon DB for the database.
*   Use JWT for authentication.

**Learnings and Project Insights:**

*   The application should focus on providing personalized and reliable information to users.
*   The application should be easy to use and provide a seamless user experience.
*   The Next.js application was created successfully using `create-next-app`.
*   User authentication has been implemented using JWT.
*   The application is connected to the Neon DB database.
*   The `users` and `progress` tables were created successfully using the `pg` package.
*   The basic pages have been created.
*   The AI Agent API route has been created and routes requests to the appropriate microservices.
*   The exercise and nutrition microservices have been implemented with personalized plans.
*   Progress tracking API endpoints have been implemented for creating, reading, updating, and deleting progress data.
*   TypeScript linting errors have been fixed by replacing `any` types with more specific types.
*   The next step is to create a user interface for progress tracking and enhance the AI Agent to provide more personalized recommendations based on user progress data.
