# System Patterns: Fit Coach AI

**System Architecture:**

*   The application will follow a microservices architecture, with separate services for:
    *   User authentication and management
    *   Exercise planning
    *   Nutrition planning
    *   AI-powered personalization
    *   Community features
    *   Integration with wearable devices
    *   Mental wellness tools
    *   Expert coaching

**Key Technical Decisions:**

*   Use Next.js API routes for backend functionality.
*   Use Neon DB for data storage.
*   Use JWT for authentication and authorization.
*   Implement AI-powered personalization using a machine learning model.

**Design Patterns in Use:**

*   Model-View-Controller (MVC) for structuring the frontend components.
*   Observer pattern for handling events and updates.
*   Factory pattern for creating different types of exercise and nutrition plans.

**Component Relationships:**

*   The frontend components will interact with the backend API routes to fetch and update data.
*   The AI-powered personalization service will consume user data and provide personalized recommendations.
*   The community features service will allow users to connect with each other and share their progress.

**Critical Implementation Paths:**

*   User registration and login
*   Exercise and nutrition plan creation
*   Progress tracking
